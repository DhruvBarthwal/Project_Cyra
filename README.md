# Project Cyra

**Cyra** is an intelligent **voice-first AI email** assistant that lets you read, manage, and send emails hands-free using natural conversation.
Built with **LangGraph**, **FastAPI**, **Gmail API**, and a modern **Next.js** UI, Cyra feels less like a tool and more like a personal assistant.
